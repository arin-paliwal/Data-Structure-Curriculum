# Data-Structure-Curriculum-
This Repository consists of a Program Code in C Language as described by our curriculum in the B.Tech Programme in the domain of Computer Science and Engineering. It consists of codes which i have used in DSA in C Language and it is also a credential subject in our curriculum.

### Write C Programs to illustrate the concept of the following:
---
1. Sorting Algorithms-(Non Recursive) Selection, Bubble, Insertion, Counting and Radix.
2. Sorting Algorithms-(Recursive) Merge & Quick.
3. Searching Algorithm-Linear and Binary.
